        I am from Ogun State, Nigeria. Originialy from Rivers State. I am excited to be 
        back in class after two years of dropping out. I started the
        online program in 2016, but I have been in and out of class 
        because of my business as it requires me to travel around the
        country. I have 45 credit hours to complete my online degree
        program after which I intend to start another degree in
        agribusiness. My interest changed since the incidence of
        the covid-19 pandemic as I was made to see the impact of 
        agriculture in my country. During the pandemic, money 
        seemed to be useless as there was a scarcity of food, it
        was then that I realized the opportunity in agriculture.
